PHP MVC framework for rapid development of web applications

## What is special about it?

nfuse is a framework to make developing web applications quick and easy. In addition to MVC goodness, the framework also gives you a free REST API and administrator dashboard for models. This can be super useful when you need to build a modern web application now. nfuse does not take long to pick up because of its carefully chosen directory structure, which was a main frustration of mine when using other frameworks. Everything is contained inside of a module to make navigating the framework easy. You will not find bits of a module scattered in various places throughout the code.

## Why another MVC framework?

I have used nfuse for several years on various projects. It suited my needs better than keeping up with the ever-changing latest framework. I decided to release nfuse despite the MVC space being already crowded because I feel that it is unique. I have gotten a lot out of the nfuse framework so am open sourcing it in hopes that someone else may benefit. This project has been built to my own taste. If something is way off base I would love to hear about it in the issues.
